<h1> Inventory Compatability </h1>

- qb
- ps
- lj
- ox <- You should **only** be using thing inventory if you run qb at all
- qs maybe

<h1> Disclaimer </h1>
since qb updated their inventory and <b>changed</b> their event names it caused suit for others to change event names as well so here is a little guide how to set this correctly

- if you use ox
  - set Config.Inv = 'ox'
- if you use **old** qb (click tab and if two inventorys pop up side by side its old)
  - Config.Inv = 'oldqb'
- if you use **new** qb (click tab and if one inventory pops up) then
  - Config.Inv = 'qb'
- if you use ps-inventory then **try**
  - Config.Inv = 'qb'
    - if that doesn't work do Config.Inv = 'oldqb'
      - if that doesn't work then set Config.Inv = 'outdated'
- if you use lj-inventory
  - Config.Inv = 'outdated'
- if you use qs-inventory then
  - Config.Inv = 'outdated'
- if you use ak47_qb_inventory then
  - Config.Inv = stop. he is known for leaks switch to ox

### some inventories hate special character so just dont use - or _ symbols just write the name

<h1>How to install like a fuckin' boss</h1>

<b> Step One </b>

- Run The SQL
  - How Do I Do That?
    - Youtube has a lot of videos
  - Do I need To?
    - I just said to.
  - How Do I Find My Database
    - Ask your server host

<b> Step Two </b>

- Fill out your config
  - follow the disclaimer above

<b> Step Three </b>

- Add the following to ```qb-smallresources/server/logs.lua```:
  - ```['mdstashes'] = 'insertyourdiscordwebhookhere',```

<p> </p>

<h1>How It Works</h1>

- use command newstash and fill in the things you want
- use command editStashes to edit the required data to open stashes
- use command DeleteStashes to delete stashes -- thanks @bobatari

<h1> Common Questions </h1>

- the items wont get out of the inventory and into my pockets
  - not my scripts problem. This is merely a way to **open** stashes. thats it. once you open the stash my script stops.
- weapons lose durability when i put them in the stash
  - again, not my script.

<h1>Fivemerr</h1>
This is NOT a requirement but something I personally use and believe in.

- to integrate with fivemerr make sure you have  ```set fivemerrLogs "API_KEY"```   in your server.cfg

- Head to /server/bridge.lua and line 3 turn local logs = true

- profit

Why integrate with Fivemerr? Its a great place to store logs as it doesnt rely on discord webhooks and its far easier to search through

As well as a place to offload images and videos from fivem that doesnt rely on discord since discord API will be automatically deleting images and videos after a certain amount of time If you need an invite to their server look below
